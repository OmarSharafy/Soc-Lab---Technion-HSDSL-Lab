Understanding a computer system requires knowledge in several fields. The lab will focus on analyzing the various bottlenecks of a computer system, the methods to overcome them, and performing measurements to analyze the efficiency of different components. Based on the analysis, changes will be implemented, and the efficiency and limitations of the bottlenecks in improving the system will be examined. The lab provides hands-on experience in implementing a hardware system based on RISC-V on an FPGA device.
